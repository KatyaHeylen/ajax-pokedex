# Pokedex

I needed to make a Pokédex using this [API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Objectives were to work with:
- a typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format;
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.

Basic functionality that was expected in Pokedex (read: core features):

1 You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
2. Of said pokémon you need to show:
- The ID-number
- An image (sprite)
- At least 4 "moves"
- The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image.
